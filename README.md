## Introduction
This project features a database design for managing the fruits and vegetables aisle of a supermarket, developed based on insights from an interview with the store owner. The schema covers key entities like product categories, suppliers, pricing, stock levels, and product data. Mock data has been added to test the database functionality, and SQL queries are provided for data retrieval and reporting. The design is scalable and can easily be extended to meet future needs, offering a practical solution for supermarket inventory management and query optimization.
## DBMS
***DB Browser for SQLite*** was used for this project. [Download here](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)
## Installation
